<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Our Commitment to Privacy</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Your privacy is important to FAITH UNION
HUB. We have developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use,
disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to
familiarise yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any
questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely
identify or contact a single person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may be asked to provide your personal information
anytime you are in contact with FAITH UNION HUB or a FAITH UNION HUB affiliated
company. FAITH UNION HUB and its affiliates may share this personal information
with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also
combine it with other information to provide and improve our products,
services, content, and advertising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This Privacy Policy describes the what,
how, and whys of collecting your information. To make it easy to find, we make
it available on our homepage and at every point where we request personally
identifiable information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In this Privacy Policy, we sometimes refer
to “you”. “You” may be a visitor to one of our websites, a user of one or more
of our Online Services, or a purchaser of our Licensed Products. We will do our
best to clarify who we are referring to at various points in the policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This Privacy Policy also describes your
choices regarding how your data is used, and how you can access, update, or
delete this information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We only collect the minimum amount of
personal information necessary to fulfil the purpose of your interaction with
us; we keep it only for as long as we have valid reasons to keep it; we never
sell or rent it to third parties, and we only use it as this Privacy Policy describes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Our business model is a very traditional
one: we provide products and services, and customers pay us for them. In other
words, you are the customer, NOT the product.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Who We Are</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From time to time, we may use your personal information to
send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to
our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to
your interaction with FAITH UNION HUB, you may not opt-out of receiving these

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Below is a complete description of the data
we collect, and what we do with the data. Every piece of information collected
is done so with a specific purpose, such as to provide our Services to you and
to fulfil our legal obligations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We call data that identifies — or that

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Transaction and Billing Information</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When purchasing directly from FAITH UNION
HUB we collect data from you in order to complete the transaction and provide
you access to our Service. To make it as secure as possible, your credit card
information (including number, expiration date and CVC security code) is sent
securely to our payment processor, Card Connect, directly from your browser.
The processor validates it and sends us a validation code we can use to finish
the purchase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We never have access to, or store, your
full credit card information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The payment processor code we use also sets
a cookie in your browser, to remember your info for future purchases. You can
delete or block that cookie if you wish; our website will continue to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We require you to enter your billing
information. This data, as well as the last four digits of your credit card,
which is sent to us by our payment processor, is stored in our FAITH UNION HUB
transaction database in order to maintain our financial records. This
information appears on your invoice, which can be accessed by anyone who has
been sent the URL link to your invoice. We make the invoice links purposefully
long and hard to guess for added security, and we prevent search engines from
indexing them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We automatically email the public invoice
link following the purchase to the email address(es) you have provided.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The history of changes to the billing
contact information on the invoice made by you or our team is logged and stored
in our FAITH UNION HUB web application.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The data we collect in FAITH UNION HUB
including Personal Data, is not shared with third parties, except for the
purposes of determining the validity of a payment. In this case we may share
the name and email address associated with the purchase with the credit card
holder, your company’s accounting department, or with our payment processor
when responding to a chargeback.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We only send emails to the email addresses
we collect in FAITH UNION HUB to communicate account activity such as purchase
confirmation and subscription status (renewal, cancellation, etc.).</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Personal Data for Online Services</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>User Account Information</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For our Online FAITH UNION HUB platform
that has the concept of a “User Account”, we store your name, email address,
and if you upload it, a photo to use as your avatar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We use this information to identify you as
a user of the Online Service.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Cookies and Other Technologies </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FAITH UNION HUB’s website, online services, interactive applications,
and email messages may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags
and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior,
tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and
measure the effectiveness of our products and services. We treat information
collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or similar identifiers
are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these
identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal
information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined
information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As is true of most websites, we gather some information
automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider
(ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and
clickstream data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to
administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather
demographic information about our user base as a whole. FAITH UNION HUB may use
this information in our marketing and advertising services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL”
linked to content on the FAITH UNION HUB website. When customers click one of these
URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the
destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us
determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our
customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you
should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format
customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use
this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For the Online Services where you have a
separate User Account, we may use cookies to identify whether you have logged
in. Therefore, your browser must be enabled to accept cookies from our Online
Service’s domain for you to use it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Passwords</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We store passwords only for Online Services
with separate FAITH UNION HUB “User Accounts.” We never store these passwords
in the clear. No-one can see them. We save them in our database using
best-practice cryptographic hashing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It is your sole responsibility to keep your
username, password, and other sensitive information confidential. If you become
aware of any unauthorised use of your account or any other breach of security,
you must notify FAITH UNION HUB immediately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you forget your password, we send you a
secure link via email that lets you reset it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>FAITH UNION HUB staff will never change a
password for you or change the Owners (as defined in the Terms of Service) or
Billing Administrators.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Communication with Us</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you send us an email to an address that
ends in Support@FAITHUNIONHUB.com, or use the online form on our website www.FAITHUNIONHUB.com,
we collect your name and email address and any additional information and
documents you send us in your correspondence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We keep that data in our help desk software
indefinitely. The customer interaction history helps us provide you with better
customer service and helps us research how to improve our products and
services.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We also use this information to proactively
contact you if we see from our logs that you are having an issue with our
Services, or if we resolved an issue you reported. If you had expressed
interest in them, or we think you might benefit from it, we also email you to
notify you of beta programs or user research interviews.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you share with us any information
including Personal Data, we treat it according to this Privacy Policy. We keep
it for the shortest amount possible and anonymise it if we can.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Newsletter</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you chose to sign up for our newsletter,
we ask you to enter your email address, so that we can send you the newsletter.
We keep your email address in our newsletter service until you unsubscribe via
the link included in every newsletter.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>User Research</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We conduct different types of user research
studies to uncover new ways of making FAITH UNION HUB better for our customers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The data we collect during research is
confidential, and we do not share it outside our company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Whenever possible, we anonymise the data.
We may use this anonymised data in our different publications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We delete personal data after each user
research study is concluded, and never keep it for longer than 5 years. You can
request to have your personal data deleted at any time.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Blog Comments</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In order to submit a comment to our blog,

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Visiting Our Online Services</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We use Google Analytics to help us in our
marketing and product design efforts, but we only track aggregate data. The
Google Analytics code we use saves up to 4 cookies on your computer. You can
delete or block those any time you wish, our website will continue to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We collect the IP addresses of everyone who
visits our site or uses our Services. This information is used for debugging

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Third-Party Vendors</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In order to keep your Personal Data as
secure as possible, we don’t own any servers of our own. Instead, we rely on
best-in-class third-party services to store your data more securely than what
we would be able to do ourselves.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Disclosure to Third Parties</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
